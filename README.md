Create HTML5 document about recipes for The Odin Project

I will be showcasing the new elements I have learnt on Html5 with things such as <h1>, <p>, <ol>, <ul>, <strong>, <em>, <a>, and <img> along with their associated attributes and names
Hopefully I demonstrate an adequate understanding of these concepts and am able to complete my first project
