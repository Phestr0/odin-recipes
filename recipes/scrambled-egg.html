                <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Scrambled eggs is a dish made from eggs stirred, whipped or beaten together while being gently heated, typically with
                         salt, butter, oil and sometimes other ingredients. In this recipe the oil will be replaced with butter and we'll be 
                         following a Gordon Ramsey-esque style. The high protein content with relatively low calories and supurb taste makes 
                        this recipe a breakfast staple in all homes.</p>

                        <h3>Steps</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Begin by breaking all 3 eggs into a pot.</li>
                                <li>Place the three knobs of butter inside the pot as well.</li>
                                <li>place the pot onto the stove, making sure the stove is on a medium to high heat.</li>
                                <li>Mix the butter and eggs with a spatule firmly so that the butter and eggs combine before they fully cook.</li>
                                <li>Once bits of cooked egg begin to form, take off the heat and make sure to scrape all contents off the bottom.</li>
                                <li>As soon as the bottom is cleaned off, place back on the heat.</li>
                                <li>Repeat this proccess until eggs are just a bit undercooked, this is because eggs continue to cook because of their own heat.</li>
                                <li>Place the eggs onto a plate and season with the salt and your choice of herbs.</li>
                                <li>Now enjoy!</li>
                            </ol>
