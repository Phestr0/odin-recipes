                <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>Bacon is a type of salt-cured pork made from various cuts, typically the belly or less fatty parts of the back. It is eaten as a side dish,
                         used as a central ingredient, or as a flavouring or accent. The recipe I am following is for candied bacon which, let's face it, is just 
                        better than other bacon. Fun fact about bacon it is a know carcinogen, probably why it is so cheap. With this in mind keep consumption of 
                    bacon to an absolute minimum.</p>

                        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>1/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
                                <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
                                <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
                                <li>1 pound thick-cut bacon</li>
                            </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Steps</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                                <li>Mix brown sugar, rice vinegar, and maple syrup in a small bowl.</li>
                                <li>Place bacon slices on a cooling rack set over a baking sheet.</li>
                                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, turn slices, and bake another 5 minutes.</li>
                                <li>Remove bacon and brush both sides with brown sugar mixture. Return bacon to the oven and bake another 5 minutes. Repeat basting every 5 minutes until bacon is browned and crisp, about 35 minutes.</li>
                                <li>Once finished, place bacon on plate and let it cool for 5 minutes.</li>
